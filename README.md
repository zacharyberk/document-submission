# Client - Treatment - Parole/Probation (CTP) Document Tracker

### About Me
My background: As someone who committed a sexual assault, I have had the privilege to work with multiple therapists and probation/parole officers (PO for short). I have learned a lot about myself and changed in more ways than 'I won't do that again'; I've learned what accountability is and how it looks like in practice, I've learned how my thoughts and feelings fed into my offending behaviors, and I've learned what kind of an impact I've made on the victims I've created - knowing that I can never truly, fully understand. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what I have learned.

### The Goal
One of the requirements made of clients like me is a way to practice our empathy by giving back to the community. I've chosen to give back to the people who've helped me most: my therapists, POs, and fellow peers also participating in treatment. Without their help, I would not be the person I am today. One area of treatment that I struggle with most the paperwork. There is a lot that we need to complete, from 3rd-party disclosures, safety plans for moving around in the community, and our coursework found in our manual. It's managable from a client stand-point, but what about my therapist who has 15 or more clients? Or my PO who has to coordinate both us and ensure that it's all on track? My goal with this project is to create a collaborative space that any member of the team can access and manage documents related to an individual's file so that everyone is on the same page.

### The Application

##### For The Client
Core features that I want to provide for the client are:
- Access to treatment documents (as mentioned above)
- Access to parole/probation documents (case plan goals, logs, etc.)
- Documents which can be autofilled (minus peer signatures) through the application
- Document submission, to be approved by therapist/PO

##### For The Therapist
Core features I want to provide for the therapist are:
- The ability to quickly identify any 'red flags' for structured paperwork
- The ability to approve/deny a document
- To create rules for individual clients to reduce the amount of back-and-forth (ensuring a client has included enough red flags, that there are enough signatures on a safety plan, etc. *before* a document is submitted)
- The ability to leave comments for the client, the PO, or both

##### For The PO
Core features I want to provide for the PO are:
- Accessibility for the entire submission process
- The ability to receive a list of everything the client has submitted since their last visit
- The ability to notify the client whether a document has been aprroved or kicked back

### Barriers to Success
One of the largest barriers to success is the need for a client to have Internet access in order to use any online system. Due to the destructive and/or compulsive behaviors we have exhibited, Internet access is a privilege that not every client has access to right away. Additionally, there will be clients who are uncomfortable about using the Internet because of their past behaviors, who don't know how, or a variety of other reasons. In addition to all the stretch goals I have listed in the next section, I would like to come up with a solution for clients who are not allowed to use the Internet or have personal concerns with Internet-enabled devices to still be able to use this system; the more participation, the more it will help everyone.

Another barrier to success is the cost to set up or maintain a system. As I will be doing the technical work, my hope is that there would be little to no cost as far as setting up; however, to maintain it will be another issue. I am currently looking at free platform-hosting solutions as an alternative to services such as Sharepoint (which would actually be an ideal solution).

### Stretch Goals
One of the more difficult things to accomplish when starting treatment is writing safety plans. They are intimidating for many (including myself) yet it is one way we can show that we are willing and able to engage in the community. A huge stretch goal for me would be to write a reactive editor that can give feedback on someone's red flags (internal and external) as well as behavior. This is a huge task because every client has individual needs, strengths, and concerns, but my vision is identifying common things such as identifying whether a behavior is camera checkable or whether a red flag would apply for this specific safety plan.

I would also like to find a way to make this system able to support mobile devices, especially on the client's end. I am under the assumption that even those of us who have a computer may not have a scanner, but phone's cameras are incredibly powerful and already have access to scanning capabilities (there are many free options through any carrier's app store). This makes documents much easier to submit for the client.

I initially wanted to include here the ability for clients to digitally sign other peer's saftey plans. However, there is a lot of room for manipulation here (trading favors or manipulating the system). This feature would be incredibly powerful for a client but I'm not sure it would be a convience at all for the therapist of that client. For now, this idea will be tabled until I can get some feedback from my team.

### Final Notes
All of this is stemmed from an idea I had years ago when I found out about giving back to my community. Is it also selfish? I think so. After all, I am one of the aforementioned clients. However, the benefit for this would (hopefully) apply to everyone in my organization. If it proves successful, perhaps it can be implemented in other treatment facilities or PO offices. One thing I want to do before I start is to get feedback and approval from my peers, my therapists, my PO, and any others who would be impacted (positively or negatively) by this project. I am also aware that my ideas are *not* an all-inclusive list and this would be a good time to ask for what would actually be useful to them.
