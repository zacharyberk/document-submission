# Client - Treatment - Parole/Probation Document Submission

My background: As someone who committed a sexual assault, I have had the privilege to work with multiple therapists and probation/parole 
officers (PO for short). I have learned a lot about myself and changed in more ways than 'I won't do that again'; I've learned what
accountability is and how it looks like in practice, I've learned how my thoughts and feelings fed into my offending behaviors, and I've
learned what kind of an impact I've made on the victims I've created - knowing that I can never truly, fully understand. This is just the
tip of the iceberg of what I have learned.

//The goal of this project is to give back to my community in a way that I find to be lacking.
